# nano-calc
Simple calculator for touch screens

This is a side project for the "Nanoblet" - the ultimate, home-made tablet.

To my surprise I could not find any simple calculator app, which would work nice on touch screens. Almost every decent calculator is either tied to particular deskop environment, or just a complicated, feature packed app, with small buttons :-(
So here it is:
- very simple
- feature rich (can evaluate complicated expressions)
- large, slightly colored buttons, easy to see and easy to touch
- when window is resized, the buttons resize, not the number display

INSTALLATION

As it is written using Python and Gtk3, obviosly both must be installed (but 99% chance that you have them already).
To install:
- copy the "nano-calc" somewhere in the PATH (e.g to /usr/local/bin), make sure it has executable flag on
- copy the "nano-calc.png" to folder which is checked for icons (e.g. /usr/local/share/pixmaps)
- copy the "nano-calc.desktop" to any of application folders (e.g. /usr/local/share/applications)
